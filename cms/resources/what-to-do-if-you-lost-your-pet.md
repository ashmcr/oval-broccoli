If your dog is lost, you need to make both a police report, and, assuming it's chipped and registered locally,  inform the chip registrars. This notification has to be made to the Microchipping Office at the Veterinary Regulation Directorate on [+356 2292 5301](tel:0035622925301) or [vafd.msdec@gov.mt](mailto:vafd.msdec@gov.mt), and has to be done within 48 hours. They will then inform the sanctuaries, vets and the animal welfare department.

If your dog isn't chipped, you still need to make a police report, but you will need to inform all the sanctuaries, vets and the animal welfare department yourself.

Animal Welfare can be informed in the following ways  

1.  Send an email to [**animalwelfare.mesdc@gov.mt**](https://www.facebook.com/notes/rubs-puppy-love/what-to-do-if-your-dog-is-lost/458750894216816/?__cft__[0]=AZVDpaUwVtndkjog88LHAYUaDa5xRF-PbvCXi_v-w7nZwazPTSAnxbmiLyB-VS_UMFaudTtqlY-QG5T1TQ01naRXa5uwR6nxdazCh-r6W1cmClRGsaIP2VsZwXwgJWi4gco&__tn__=*OH-R&cquick=jsc_c_gr&cquick_token=AQ7IkbSop3cKUw3J&ctarget=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com#)  with the description and/or photo of the dog and any other useful information together with contact details; or  
    
2.  Call [1717](tel:1717) (or [+356 7969 1717](tel:0035679691717) for Gozo ) and give the description of the dog and any other useful information together with contact details;  
    
3.  Upload photo on the Malta Animal Welfare app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/mt/app/malta-animal-welfare/id1148534815) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mt.gov.maltaanimalwelfare&hl=en)).

All dogs 4 months and older must be microchipped, and at any age wear an ID tag on their collar/harness when in public. Having no chip or no ID tag is punishable by a €300 fine. You also significantly reduce the chances of getting your dog back if you don't.
