Although those are the official dog friendly bays, you can take your dog swimming anywhere as long as:

1.  It is not a sandy beach, unless listed above or there is a sign allowing dogs;
2.  It is not an official bathing zone\*, unless listed above or there is a sign allowing dogs;
3.  There isn't a local council sign banning dogs.

\*Official bathing zones are not the same as swimming areas. A swimming area is summer only and marked by buoys. A bathing zone is year round, generally not marked and are typically larger than a swimming area.
