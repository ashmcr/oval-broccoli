Noah's Ark has rescued hundreds of dogs. Of course, the ideal is to find new homes for them but, sadly, this is not always possible. In addition to food, several of the animals that have been taken in have required medical treatment, which is, of course, paid for by Noah's Ark.

Donations do not have to be of the financial kind, of course. There is always a need for suitable bedding, for example, and such things as food bowls and collars and leads that are no longer required.
