The Association for Abandoned Animals focus on making the maximum positive impact on the lives of their rescued dogs. Their members and volunteers provide the momentum that helps to continue with their work. They rely solely from the kind donations of the public to continue with our mission and important work.

In 2018 they relocated to a newly refurbished Sanctuary in Birzebbugia, which allows them better facilities to serve the community and rescued dogs. If you want to adopt a dog, then they are awaiting for you with open arms.
