Animal Care Malta has been dedicated to the welfare of animals since 2001.

Their priority is to take care of the cats in their private sanctuary and the cat colonies in the area. Most of the cats in their care were found abandoned when they were tiny kittens; many of them were bottle fed, some of them from the day they were born. Others were saved from dangerous places and/or they were sick or handicapped.
