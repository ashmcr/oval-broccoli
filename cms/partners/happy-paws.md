Happy Paws provide subsidised neutering in their own veterinary clinic for those caretakers who have joined their team.

Apart from their resident veterinary staff, it is completely run by volunteers. The organisation is financed by operating two charity shops, through sponsorships, donations, their Rainbow wall, and fund-raising events.

In 2008, they opened the Happy Paws Animal Clinic – the only dedicated spay and neuter clinic of its kind in Malta.
