Martin is shy at first and might bark at you but as soon as he has a good sniff and gets to know you he is the most loving and friendly boy. He likes scratches and playing with his toys.

Martin is extremely smart and would love training and long walks and runs in the country side. He is ok with children but too many at one time might make him a little stressed.
