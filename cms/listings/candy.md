Candy loves being around humans, and enjoys it when being groomed as she simply adores attention. Being very affectionate, she will follow you everywhere, and while youâ€™re working she will gladly watch you, and long for a treat or two in return for her company.

Candy is a two-year-old neutered female cat. She has some vestibular issues which means that she keeps her head tilted to one side. Unfortunately there is not much that can be done regarding this, but it does not seem to have affected her balance very much. She also has some liver issues. We are waiting for info from the vet too to confirm the full report.
