Nina is a two-year-old neutered female cat. She has a few issues because she sometimes likes to bite people to greet them, but not in an aggressive manner. Rather it is because she is quite bored here and really wants to play. It has been difficult to find her a home because of this. She also does not like other cats and we do not think she would be good with young children.Â   

Nina can be affectionate, but when she feels like it, she needs her personal space and its either her way or the highway! She simply loves catnip and will spend hours playing with it. She is not too fussy, only demands good food, fresh water and anything which comes to her mind.
