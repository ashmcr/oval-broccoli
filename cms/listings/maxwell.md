Max has been at the shelter 3 months. He is shy with new people but only until he gets to trust you. He is then very friendly and would love to play football with you.

He loves to sniff and investigate his surrounding to make sure thereâ€™s no balls hidden around. He would love a garden to run around and to take long walks outside.  

As he loves football so much he might be possessive if you try to take the ball from his mouth.
