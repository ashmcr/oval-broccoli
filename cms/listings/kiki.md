Kiki is a very friendly 6-year-old brown fox terrier. When he came in he had a large lump, it was diagnosed as a non-aggressive cancer. This was removed (along with a few smaller lumps). It was about 800 grams in size which is really huge for a dog that weighs about 10 kgs!   

Kiki is now well on the way to recovering, as you may see in the post-operation photos, and he is such a lovely boy, all he needs is a proper home and reciprocal company.
