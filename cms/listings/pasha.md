Pasha is a 5-year-old neutered male husky mix. Pasha has been returned to the MSPCA twice because he is very protective over his resources (including toys, food, and space). He is not an aggressive dog at all, he just needs someone who understands that he likes his own space and doesn't want someone who is constantly tugging at him or touching and/or removing his things. When his space is respected, Pasha is a very friendly and cuddly dog. Not appropriate for a family with young children. 

He also needs someone who understands basic dog behaviour and who is willing to give him basic dog training. The thing about Pasha is that he is truly a super smart dog, but needs an owner who sets the rules and enforces them, he’ll be very happy to follow. Unfortunately, it is not easy to make new owners understand this. At the MSPCA rehoming centre they have been working very hard to reduce his resource-guarding and they have seen an improvement but it is quite clear that Pasha is feeling lonely and bored, so it would be wonderful to find him a good home soon. 

Pasha can be a good guard and offer security, and loves to play in fields or gardens, he just needs some training to get used to small spaces. We truly believe that with some special attention and an owner who is willing to invest in basic dog behaviour training, he could be an amazing companion.
